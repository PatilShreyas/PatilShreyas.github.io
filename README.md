## üöÄ Migration to Hugo

This portfolio has been migrated from pure HTML/CSS/JS to Hugo for better content management and maintainability. The new setup includes:

- **Hugo Static Site Generator** for content management
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **Dark theme** with minimalist design
- **Markdown content** for easy updates
- **YAML data files** for structured content
- **Animated elements** and smooth interactions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Content Structure
- `content/` - Markdown content files
- `data/` - YAML data files for structured content
- `layouts/` - Hugo templates and partials
- `static/` - Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `hugo.toml` - Site configuration

### Key Sections
- **About Me** - Personal introduction and background
- **Experience** - Professional work history
- **Community** - Google Developer Expert and community involvement
- **Education** - Academic background
- **Workshops** - Speaking engagements and sessions
- **Work** - Apps/Software and Open Source projects

```


#### Workshops/Sessions

### Adding New Sections

2. Add corresponding section in `layouts/index.html`
3. Update navigation menu in `hugo.toml`

## üé® Customization

### Theme Colors
Primary accent color is defined in `hugo.toml` and used throughout the site. To change:
1. Update Tailwind config in `layouts/_default/baseof.html`
2. Modify CSS custom properties in `static/css/custom.css`

### Animations
- AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for scroll animations
- Custom CSS animations for text cycling and hover effects
- JavaScript handles interactive elements

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The site can be deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Set up Hugo GitHub Action workflow
3. Push changes to trigger deployment

### Netlify
Current deployment is on Netlify with automatic builds from the main branch.

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build the site
hugo --minify

# Deploy the 'public/' directory to your hosting provider
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **YAML Syntax Errors**: Ensure proper indentation and escaping in data files
2. **Missing Images**: Check image paths in `static/` directory
3. **Build Failures**: Run `hugo --buildDrafts` to see detailed error messages

### Development Tips
- Use `hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender` for full rebuilds
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Validate YAML syntax before committing changes
