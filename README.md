- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PatilShreyas/PatilShreyas.github.io.git
cd PatilShreyas.github.io

# Start Hugo development server
hugo server

# Site will be available at http://localhost:1313
```

### CSS Development (Optional)
If you need to modify Tailwind CSS:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only needed for CSS changes)
npm install

# Build optimized CSS after making Tailwind changes
npm run build-css

# Commit the generated CSS file
git add static/css/tailwind.css
git commit -m "Update optimized CSS"
```

### Available npm Scripts (Development Only)
```bash
npm run build-css    # Build optimized Tailwind CSS
npm run watch-css    # Watch for changes and rebuild CSS
npm run build        # Build both CSS and Hugo site
```

### CSS Development Notes
- **Source:** `src/input.css` (Tailwind directives and custom CSS)
- **Output:** `static/css/tailwind.css` (committed to repository)
- **Config:** `tailwind.config.js` (Tailwind configuration)
- **Deployment:** CSS is pre-generated and committed, no build step needed

### Building for Production
```bash
hugo --minify

# Output will be in the 'public/' directory
```

Configured in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml).
